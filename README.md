# xor-neural-network
A multi-layered neural network that models the fundamental logic gate XOR.
The mathematical function sigmoid(x) is set as the activation function and randomly-initialized weight / bias matrix are used, which improve along with the process-cycle, by deploying a batch gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.1. The code for the neural network is implemented in Python3.
